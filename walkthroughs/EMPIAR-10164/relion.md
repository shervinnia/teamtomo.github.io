# Particle pose optimisation

Now that we have a set of particles that's mostly free of duplicates and matches our geometrical understanding of the system, we can proceed to refine of our particle poses with the aim of producing a higher resolution average.
````{margin}
```{note}
Working between `RELION` and `Warp` in this section does make things a little more complicated. 
We work in this way to take advantage of Warp's CTF correction and the CTF volumes it generates to describe sampling of Fourier coefficients.
```
````
In this section, we will:
- Extract particles in Warp at 5Å/px
- Align these particles by subtomogram averaging in RELION
- Repeat the previous two steps at 1.6Å/px
```{tip}
Subtomogram averaging becomes very slow when performing refinements with lots of particles in larger boxes. Stepping the pixel size down gradually allows us to move more quickly and react to any problems which may come up when working on more complex data.
```

## Reconstruct subtomograms in Warp at 5Å/px

### Generate compatible metadata
Our metadata is currently in the dynamo format.
We need to convert our particle positions and orientations into a format Warp understands, we will use the `dynamo2warp` script provided by the 
[`dynamo2m`](https://github.com/alisterburt/dynamo2m)
package. The script takes a `.tbl` file (which we generated at the end of the previous section) and a table map file. The table map file contains a mapping from particle indexes to file names, to match to the column 20 of the `.tbl` file. In our case, this file is located in `dynamo/findparticlesData.Boxes/indices_column20.doc`.

````{margin}
```{tip}
the scripts in `dynamo2m` can also be run interactively, just type `dynamo2warp` at the command line if you prefer this!
```
````

In a terminal, run:
```bash
dynamo2warp -i result_10Apx_nodup_neighbourcleaning.tbl -tm ../../../../findparticlesData.Boxes/indices_column20.doc -o result_10Apx_nodup_neighbourcleaning_data.star
```

### Subtomogram reconstruction in Warp
We can now use the generated `.star` file to reconstruct subtomograms from our tilt-series in Warp. To start the reconstruction, make sure Warp is in `*.tomostar` mode, then click on the `Reconstruct sub-tomograms` button at the top of the screen in the `Overview` tab and select `result_10Apx_nodup_neighbourcleaning_data.star`. A dialog will open; fill in the settings as follows, making sure the radio buttons all selected correctly:

````{margin}
```{note}
We reconstruct at a box twice as large as before because we have halved the pixel spacing.
```

```{note}
Note that the `particle diameter` is used to generate a normalization mask, and does *not* affect the size of the box. Here we choose a size that encompasses only the central hexamer, since that's the part we are interested in.
```
````

```

When ready, click on `EXPORT`. To prepare the directory structure for relion, we will choose to put the output `.star` file inside a new `relion` folder in the project root directory, and call it `subtomograms_5Apx.star`.

## 3D auto-refine in RELION

We can now perform a gold standard automatic refinement of the whole dataset at 5Å/px in `RELION`. Working in `RELION` at this stage simplifies the workflow and allows us to take advantage of its maximum-likelihood approaches to refinement and classification.

At this stage, we choose **not** to use a density-based mask during refinement. This allows us to make use of the neighbouring density in the lattice to drive these initial alignments. We will use a mask later when aiming for more precise, local alignment of the central hexamer.

```{note}
By default, Dynamo uses a binary wedge model to account for the sampling of information in Fourier space for each subtomogram. Warps CTF volumes are designed for use with RELION and should yield more accurate weighting of Fourier coefficients during reconstruction.
```

Before alignment, we need to create an initial reference for the alignment procedure. We select a random subset of particles with simple bash commands:
```bash
# keep the header
head subtomograms_5Apx.star -n 30 > random_subset_5Apx.star
# use 500 random particles
tail subtomograms_5Apx.star -n +31 | shuf -n 500 >> random_subset_5Apx.star
```

Then, we use `relion_reconstruct` from the command line to align and average them. We need to make sure to appropriately weight the reconstruction according to the CTF volumes and tell the program that we are working with 3D images.

````{margin}
```{tip}
To get the help page of any relion command, simply run it without options.
```
````

```bash
relion_reconstruct --i random_subset_5Apx.star --o random_subset_5Apx.mrc --3d_rot --ctf --sym C6
```

This step also serves as a useful sanity check. The resulting reconstruction should look like the hexagonal lattice we have seen previously. If it doesn't, something went wrong: check your parameters carefully for each step.

### Alignment in RELION

To start the project, run *relion* from the `relion` directory.
```bash
relion
```

We then set up a 3D auto-refine job as following:

We will refine without a mask for now as this refinement serves only to make sure that the particles remain well centered and we expect to go significantly beyond 10Å.

## Subtomogram reconstruction at 1.6Å/px

```{warning}
We reconstructed at 1.6Å/px rather than 1.35Å/px due to memory limitations. Warp works with larger images internally to reduce the effects of CTF aliasing. The large number of particles per field-of-view is particularly demanding at such a small pixel size and can lead to memory issues. Unless working at a very small pixel size, you are unlikely to encounter these issues when working with your own data.
```

````{margin}
```{tip}
When doing Fourier transforms, some box sizes are more efficient than others.
See [here](https://blake.bcm.edu/emanwiki/EMAN2/BoxSize) for more details.
```
````
Once the alignment at 5Å/px is done, we can perform alignments at a smaller pixel size to obtain a higher resolution reconstruction. We use Warp to reconstruct sutomograms at 1.6Å/px using the `*_data.star` from the refinement at 5Å/px then rerun the alignments in Relion. This time, we will perform our refinements in a mask around the central hexamer.

First, we need to reformat the output `.star` file from the Relion3.1 specification (not supported by Warp 1.0.9) to Relion3.0, using a command provided by `dynamo2m`. To do so, navigate to `relion/Refine3D/refine_5apx` and identify the last iteration number (for us, it was `it_023`) and run:
```bash
relion_star_downgrade -s run_it023_data.star
```


From the new file `run_it023_data_rln3.0.star`, we can now reconstruct subtomograms in Warp. This time, the input coordinates use 5Å/px and the output should be scaled to 1.6Å/px. To optimise computational speed, we choose a box size of 128 px here. This is a little smaller than our previous box size, but still big enough for our particle.

```{attention}
Using small box sizes, especially for particles with a large defocus containing fast CTF oscillations, can lead to CTF aliasing. 
We can use a fairly small box here because Warp implements an aliasing-free reconstruction algorithm to avoid this.
```

Save the file in the `relion` directory as `subtomograms_1.6Apx.star`

```{image} relion.assets/subtomo-extraction-1-6.png
:width: 300px
```

Generate a reconstruction at 1.6Å/px using `relion_reconstruct` with the following command.

```bash
relion_reconstruct --i subtomograms_1.6Apx.star --o reconstruction_1.6Apx.mrc --3d_rot --ctf --sym C6
```

## Creating a mask for refinement

````{margin}
```{tip}
Focussing a refinement on a region of interest can yield better alignments for that region, particularly for flexible proteins. 
The masked region should contain enough signal to drive alignments. How big this region can be depends a lot on data quality.
```
````
To focus our refinements on the central hexamer, we need to produce a mask around this region.
The mask should have a soft edge, this avoids introducing bias into masked FSC calculations, see [here](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.ultramic.2013.06.004) for discussion.

To produce our mask we will
- produce a map containing only the central hexamer
- use this map to generate a soft-edged mask around the central hexamer

We can quickly mask out the central hexamer interactively using tools in `Dynamo`.
In `MATLAB` with `Dynamo` activated, load your reconstruction at 1.6Å/px into an old version of the `dynamo_mapview` GUI.
```matlab
dpkdev.legacy.dynamo_mapview('reconstruction_1.6Apx.mrc')
```

The mask should be a cylinder with a diameter of 160Å around the central hexamer of the lattice. See our [mini-tutorial on mask creation](../../mini-tutorials/dynamo/interactive-mask-creation) for details on creating the mask.

Once you're happy with the mask, mask your volume and save it as `central_hexamer_1.6Apx.mrc` from the GUI.
````{margin}
```{tip}
It's important to check your masks
```
````

Open your `central_hexamer_1.6Apx.mrc` in your favourite program and determine an appropriate threshold for binarisation. Use this as the `--ini_threshold` parameter in the following command.

```bash
relion_mask_create --i central_hexamer_1.6Apx.mrc --angpix 1.6 --extend_inimask 5 --width_soft_edge 10 --o mask_1.6Apx.mrc --ini_threshold 0.05
```

## Refinement at 1.6Å/px

Now that we have a mask, we can set up a relion 3D auto-refine job like we did before. A few parameters require changes:
- change the name of the project in `Current` under the `I/O` tab to reflect the smaller pixel size; we used `refine_1.6Apx`
- inputs should now be the `_1.6Apx` star file, reference and mask we generated, respectively:
    - `subtomograms_1.6Apx.star`
    - `reconstruction_1.6Apx.mrc`
    - `mask_1.6Apx.mrc`
- the inital low pass filter under the `Reference` tab can be set up to the estimated resolution from the previous refinement at 5Å/px. This will speed up the convergence of the refinement. In our case, 15 is appropriate.
- the mask diameter in the `Optimisation` tab should be lowered to 160Å to encompass only the central hexamer.
- the inital and local searched for angular sampling in the `Auto-sampling` tab can be restricted to 1.8 degrees.

Leaving the rest as before, press `Run!` to start processing. Once the processing is done, we are ready to move on to the multi-particle refinement in `M`.
