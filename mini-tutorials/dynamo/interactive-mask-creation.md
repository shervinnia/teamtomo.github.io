# Interactive mask creation

`Dynamo` contains some really useful interactive tools for creating shape masks.
In this mini-tutorial, we will use a legacy version of the `dynamo_mapview` GUI to create and apply a shaped mask on a reference.

## Loading our data into mapview
First, we load our volume `my_volume.mrc` into the GUI with the following command

```matlab
dpkdev.legacy.dynamo_mapview('my_volume.mrc');
```

## Getting comfortable with the viewer
Here we go over some of the controls available in this viewer, you might have noticed there are a lot!

````{tab-set}
```{tab-item} x/y/z view
You can switch between viewing x-, y- or z-slices with the `x`, `y` and `z` buttons.

```

```{tab-item} slice mode
You can switch between viewing either a single projection or a set of slices

```

```{tab-item} Fourier filters
Bandpass filters can be applied from the GUI by setting the `band` parameters then hitting the `band` button. The filter frequencies are set in Fourier pixels.

```

```{tab-item} symmetry
Symmetry can be applied from the GUI. Symmetry is applied along the z-axis of the volume.

```

```{tab-item} reset
The volume visualised can be reset to its original state at any time with the `reset` button.

## Mask creation
This section covers the basics of mask creation in `dpkdev.legacy.dynamo_mapview()`

````{tab-set}
```{tab-item} mask creation
You can create a shaped mask by 
- selecting the check-box next to the word shape in the `Mask` section
- selecting either `cylinder` or `ellipsoid`
- setting the x-, y- and z- radii and centers

hit the `layer` button to bring up a visualisation of the mask on the currently depicted slices.

```

```{tab-item} saving a mask
You can save a mask by setting a filename in the `Mask` section and hitting `save`
![save mask image](interactive-mask-creation.assets/savemask.gif)
```

```{tab-item} saving a masked volume
You can apply a mask onto a volume and save the volume in the `File I/O` section
