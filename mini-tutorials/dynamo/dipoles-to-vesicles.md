# Spherical vesicle picking

## Overview
This mini-tutorial will show you how to quickly and easily generate an oversampled set of positions
and orientations on a spherical supporting geometry (such as a vesicle) in `Dynamo`

We start from a `Dynamo` catalogue containing the tomograms with vesicles we want to pick.

## Motivation
Vesicle models in `Dynamo` are spheres or ellipsoids fit to a point cloud, 
this is robust but increases the time spent on annotation.

Spheres are uniquely defined by a center point and a radius. 
Center and edge points of a vesicle in a tomogram are easily annotated using the `dipoleSet` model type.

## Tomogram annotation

### General approach
Spheres can be completely defined by only two values, their centre point and their radius. We will 
1. Create a `dipoleSet` model in each tomogram
2. Convert these `dipoleSet` models into oversampled `vesicle` models 

Using the `dipoleSet` model let's us quickly define a center and an edge point for many spherical objects

### Create a `dipoleSet` model

`dtmslice` controls
^^^
If you haven't used `dtmslice` before, get familiar by reading [this page](dtmslice-controls) and playing with it for five minutes.

Generating `dipoleSet`s can be done with three simple shortcuts:
- `c` to set a center point for the current dipole
- `n` to set a north point for the current dipole
- `Enter` to save the current dipole and move to the next one
```

Open your tomogram in `dtmslice` from the `dcm` (`Dynamo` catalogue manager) GUI:
```
View volume -> Full tomogram file in tomoslice
```
Create a `dipoleSet` model from the menu:
```
Model pool -> Create new model in pool (choose type) -> Oriented particles (dipole set)
```

### Picking dipoles

Move the slice in the tomogram and roughly pick the center point of your sphere by moving the cursor to that point and pressing `c`. 
Then, move the cursor to a point on the surface of the same vescicle and press `n` (north) to define an edge point. 

A surface rendering of the defined sphere will appear; move the slice and look at the object from different orientations to make sure that the sphere matches your object well. When satisfied, hit `Enter` to move to the next vesicle

```{tip}
Use the `x`, `y` and `z` keys to change the orientation of the current slice
```

Once all the objects in a tomogram are picked, save the model by clicking on `Active Model -> Save active model into catalogue (disk)` or clicking the floppy disk icon in the menu bar.

Close the tomoslice window and repeat this process for each tomogram in your dataset.

```{note}
If Dynamo asks what to do with the model in pool memory and you already saved the model, choose to delete it. Dynamo may show some elements of the previous `dipoleSet` model when opening a new tomogram. This is a visualisation bug, and does not affect the creation of a new model.
```

### Convert dipoleSet models into oversampled Vesicle models

Once all the dipole models are picked, we can convert them into oversampled `Vesicle` models. For this, we will use the script [`dipoles2vesicles.m`](https://gist.github.com/alisterburt/818c604af41050532a378afb93ae556f). The function generates a Dynamo `Vescicle` model for every dipole in each `dipoleSet` model in a catalogue.

For example, to generate the `Vesicle` models from a catalogue called `catalogue` with an expected inter-particle distance of `7.5`px we would run the following command from the folder containing the catalogue:

    model_files = dir(p);

    for model_idx = 1:length(model_files)
        current_file = model_files(model_idx)
        model_file = fullfile(current_file.folder, current_file.name)
        fprintf('Now reading %s\n', model_file);
        vesicles_from_dipoles(model_file, distance_between_particles)
    end
end


function vesicles_from_dipoles(model_file, expected_inter_particle_distance)
    ds = dread(model_file);

    % checks the number of individual dipoles
    disp(sprintf('Found %d dipoles in the set',length(ds.dipoles)));

    % loops on all the dipoles present in the set
    for i=1:length(ds.dipoles);

        % selects the i-th individual dipole in the set
        dipole = ds.dipoles{i};

        % creates a vesicle model   
        v = dmodels.vesicle();

        % prepares a name for each individual dipole
        v.name = sprintf('%s_rawVesicle_%d',ds.name,i);

        % links the created model with the catalogued volume 
        % of the dipole set module
        v.cvolume = ds.cvolume;

        % initiates the vesicle model
        v.center = dipole.center;
        v.radius = norm(dipole.center - dipole.north);
        
        % add in info about average distance between particle positions on
        % surface
        v.separation = expected_inter_particle_distance / 1.5;
        v.updateCrop();

        % saves the model back into the catalogue
        v.saveInCatalogue();

    end
end
