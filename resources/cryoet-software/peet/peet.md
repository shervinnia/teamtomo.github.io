# PEET

[PEET](https://bio3d.colorado.edu/PEET/) is subtomogram averaging
package developed and maintained by the University of Colorado at
at Boulder. PEET is free, open-source, and is supported on Linux, 
MacOS, and Windows. Please see the link above for binaries, source 
code, and documentation.

PEET is distributed as a separate package but integrates with and
is typically used in conjunction with the 
[Imod](https://teamtomo.org/resources/cryoet-software/imod/imod.html) 
tomography and modeling package. PEET is written in
Matlab<sup>&reg;</sup> but does not require a prior
Matlab<sup>&reg;</sup> installation to use. A graphical user interface 
provides easy access to basic operations, while more advanced operations 
and customization are supported via the command line with optional shell 
or Matlab<sup>&reg;</sup> scripting.

PEET was first described in
[Nicastro et al, 2006](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1128618).
